# Kotlin Collection Operations and Null Safety

This example showcases basic collection operations in Kotlin: using `map` on a `List` and iterating through a `Map`.

While seemingly simple, this code highlights potential pitfalls when working with collections, particularly the risk of `NullPointerExceptions` if not handled properly.  The solution demonstrates best practices for null safety.

## How to Run

Save the code in `KotlinCollectionOperations.kt` and `KotlinCollectionOperationsSolution.kt`, then compile and run using a Kotlin compiler (e.g., Kotlin/JVM).
